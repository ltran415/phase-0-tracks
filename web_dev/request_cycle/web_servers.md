In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

- A VPS is a virtual server that the user can use as a dedicated server; a computer running somewhere that you pay for.
  - advantages:
    * you have more control over a virtual server than shared hosting, meaning you will have root access and the ability to use certain scripts that are not allowed in other environments.
    * Is less expensive than a full dedicated hosting plan that uses a physical server.


Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

- It's good practice to run applications as a user level and leave administrative task to the root user. Limiting access by creating a user account can prevent an application that is meant to be ran with non-administrative security to modify the underlying system.
