What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

- A get request is a method to retrieve information from whatever is identified in the request.
- A post request is a method that request the server to accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified
the request.
- The difference between the two is that one method is used for reading and retrieving data, while the other is writing and sending data.


Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

- Cookies are data that is stored in small text files on our computers. They allow you to store user information in web pages.
- It relates to HTTP requests because it allows for information to be stored in a web browser while the user is browsing, like adding an item to a shopping cart on a web page for instance.
