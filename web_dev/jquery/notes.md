Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

First I will start by looking up beginner syntax for jquery. Then follow the code examples and
compare the process with Javascript. It's easiest for me to learn a new language by comparing it
to what I already understand. Then I will figure out what sort of work flow to follow and test it
out.

What is jquery:
- It is a fast and small feature rich Javascript library
- Jquery gives you a library of commands to execute
- The shorthand for jquery is $
- A gives you a way of accessing elements on a webpage
- Your jquery code always goes in a document ready function, as follows:
```
<script>
  $(document).ready(function)() {
  });
</script>
```
- The following code allows you to require jquery locally:
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>
```
- This tells the document to wait until the document is fully loaded
before it runs any javascript code.
- It is very similar to javascript in that you can create a separate script file for your code, as follows:
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
```
